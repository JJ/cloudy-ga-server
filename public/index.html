	  <aside class='notes'>The idea of people as computing nodes
	  was, as far as I know, introduced by this mostly forgotten
	  novel from the fifties,
	  called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfbane_(novel)'>Wolfbane, by Frederick
	      Pohl and Cyril Kornbluth</a>,
	  where humans are linked to a complex
	    machine and, in ocassions, to each other forming <em>snowflakes</em>. No
	  spoiler, here, but the basic idea is that people were being
	    used as computing nodes. Just like here. Well, more or less.</aside>

	      running a distributed evolutionary algorithm</aside>

	  <section><h1>You are evolving solutions to the HIFF problem</h1></section>

	res.send( { 'chromosome': one } );
//more stuff here
    } 
  });		
	    </code></pre>

	    <aside class='notes'>It uses REST via express, a very
	    simple interface, no fancy setup or anything. Very low
	      overhead. But it's getting one <em>chromosome</em> in
	    the evolutionary algorithm via a PUT request, and sending
	      back a random chromosome off those stored.</aside>

</code></pre>

<aside class='notes'>In this client-side code, using JQuery and a
  browserified version of NodEO, an evolutionary algorithm written in
  Node, but the key is that there's this little Ajax request to the
  previous server. It's getting some little guy back from the server,
  and putting it back into the population</aside>
